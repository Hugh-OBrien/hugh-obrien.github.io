An incomplete list of ongoing current personal projects. Only things far enough along to have showable content here.

## [Previously in Europe](http://previouslyineurope.eu)

I make a weekly podcast with Ciaran Dold about European Politics. I made a small site for it which lives [here](http://previouslyineurope.eu).

The site is intended to host some data visualisations relevant to current events... they'll mostly be maps

## Tensorflow with Unity

Possible directions:
- Something turn based where a pre-trained network could make AI decisions
- Using pattern transfer techniques in an interactive way
- Some application of image recognition to feed into a game mechanic

A proof of concept for running the library in the engine at runtime - [here]({% post_url 2017-02-12-tensorflow-for-unity %} )

## Retired & Completed Projects

### [Historical Beef](https://elliotpage.itch.io/historical-beef) (Completed)
A game jam game about placing meat. Made with [Elliot Page](https://twitter.com/elliotpage). At time of writing it was the only meat placing video game available.

### Beholdr (Retired)
A webapp for some podcast tools. Included analytics and review aggregation from different sources largely to get around the lack of management tools from apple podcasts. 

Using:
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- D3.js
