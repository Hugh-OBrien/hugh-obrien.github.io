An incomplete list of current projects:

<h2>Tensorflow with Unity</h2>
Looking into interesting ways to use Tensorflow with Unity. The choice of framework and engine is not really down to either being best suited for the job. Lightweight simpler versions of both might be better long term; however my familarity with both has made getting small prototypes functioning much easier.

Possible directions:
- Something turn based where a pre-trained deep network could made the AI decisions
- Using pattern transfer techniques in an interactive way
- Some application of image recognition to feed into a game mechanic

<h2>Beholdr</h2>
A webapp and home of a podcast network.

Using:

- Django
- PostgreSQL
- D3.js

Mostly done, at tidying up stage
