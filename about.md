I'm a software developer currently working at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) in London.

Long ago I got a psychology degree at Trinity College Dublin with great ambitions to work in the field in some capacity. After that I worked in scientific publishing for a couple of years at PLOS, an open access publisher based in San Fransisco and Cambridge - though I was never lucky enough to make it to the SF office...

In 2016 I left the glamorous world of publishing to go do something completely different. I got my MSc in computer science at Imperial College London with a final project working on deep learning applications for medical imaging.

In my spare time I sometimes make stuff and sometimes I post it here. Things I'm vaguely working on usually include:
- Web stuff
- Machine learning
- Video games
- Audio (currenly spending some time messing around with Ardour plugins...)
- Combinations of the above

This site mainly exists to drive me to finish up projects and make vague progess on my to do lists; however if you find yourself here for whatever reason feel free to contact me about anything on here or related things
