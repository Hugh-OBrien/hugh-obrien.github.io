I'm a software developer currently working at [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) in London.

I have a balechors in psychology from Trinity College Dublin and a masters in computer science from Imperial College London. Between the two I worked at [PLOS](https://www.plos.org/) in publications.

This site lagrely serves for my own use to motivate progress on personal projects. It's also worked out as the logical place to keep progress and results/links.

If anyone finds any of this useful or interesting please feel free to reach out, it's been cool to hear back from people about things I've put on here. Email and some social media in the footer.
